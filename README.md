# 👩🏻‍💻🤖🧠🖥️ Machine Learning 
| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| 🚙 🚚 📷 [Interpreting an Image Classifier Project](https://github.com/hhaeri/Interpreting_Image_Classifiers) | Sep 2023 | Python, PyTorch, OmniXAI | Developed and implemented an image classifier interpretation tool. The pipeline encompassed utilizing a pre-trained RESNET model to create predictions for chosen images and employing model-agnostic interpretation tools via OmniXAI to delve into the underlying rationales guiding the model's decisions. |
| :syringe: [Prediction of Daily County Level COVID Cases in School Age Population using Machine Learning](https://github.com/hhaeri/TDI_Capstone) | Mar 2022 |Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, scikit-learn, Streamlit | Designed, created, and deployed a custom time series forecasting model to predict county_level daily COVID-19 case count in the State of California using Python and Streamlit on Jupyter Notebook. |

# 👩🏻‍💻🖥️ Data Wrangling
